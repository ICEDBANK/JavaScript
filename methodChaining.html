    <h1>Method Chaining</h1>
    <p>
        The purpose of method chaining is to write more concise and expressive code,
        reducing the need for intermediate variables and making the code easier to
        read and understand. It can also lead to cleaner and more fluent APIs, as it
        allows you to perform a series of operations on an object in a linear and
        sequential manner.
